Tree Based Model for Retention Data

Mock data used to showcase how I analyzed a dataset in python to garner insights that could increase employee retention. Began with data cleaning and 
exploratory data analysis, before coding some visualizations to try and notice patterns between variables.

This scatterplot can help notice trends of two possible groups: those who were overworked and performed well until they quit, and those who performed poorly and were let go.

Through this analysis I tried to identify the biggest variables that led to employees leaving Sailfort Motors, in order to allow HR and 
upper leadership to try and amend these shortcomings. 

This dataset contained 15,000 rows and 10 columns, which are further defined in the project itself. 

After conducting feature engineering, the decision tree model achieved AUC of 96.98%, precision of 97.35%, recall of 91.51%, accuracy of 98.14%, and an f1-score of 94.33%. This model's performance gave me great confidence in the findings.
